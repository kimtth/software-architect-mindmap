1. [Are Architecture Styles, Patterns, and Design Patterns Different?](https://x.com/milan_milanovic/status/1747683090598711725?s=20)

    - **Architecture Styles vs Patterns vs Design Patterns**

        1. **Architectural styles**

            This is the highest level of abstraction, where architectural designs instruct us on structuring our code. The highest level of granularity describes the application's layers and high-level modules and how they relate to and interact with one another. Examples of architectural styles include:
            
            🔹 Monolith

            🔹 Layered

            🔹 Event-driven

            🔹 Self-contained Systems

            🔹 Microservices

            🔹 Space-Based

        2. **Architectural patterns**

            These patterns represent a way to implement an architectural style, so we can do this regularly. Some examples are how to separate the user interface (UI) and data, how internal modules interact, and what layers we will use. Patterns answer these types of questions. They usually impact the code base and how to structure the code inside. Examples of architectural patterns include:

            🔹 Model-View-Presenter (MVP): 1:1 Relationship between View and Presenter. e.g., Windows forms
            
            🔹 Model-View-Controller (MVC): e.g., Smalltalk, ASP.Net MVC
            
            🔹 Model–View–Viewmodel (MVVM): One to Many relationship between View and ViewModel. e.g., Silverlight, WPF, AngularJs: 
            
            🔹 Domain-Driven Design

        3. **Design patterns**

            These differ from architectural patterns in that they focus on a smaller code base area and have a smaller influence (focus on a local problem). These include limiting the creation of a class to only one object or notifying all dependent objects when the internal state of an object is changed. These patterns are described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides from 1994.

            We have three groups of Design Patterns:

            🔹 Creational: here we have Factory Method, Builder, Singleton, ...
            
            🔹 Structural: here we have an Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator, ...
            
            🔹 Behavioral: here we have Command, Iterator, State, Strategy, ...

1. Memory consistency model: [A Primer on Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01764-3)

    - **SC vs TSO vs Relaxed Memory Consistency**

        1. Sequential Consistency (SC): Operations execute in order as per the program.
        
            🔹 SC preserves order for two memory operations from the same thread for all four combinations of loads and stores (Load → Load, Load → Store, Store → Store, and Store → Load). 
            
            🔹 MIPS R10000

        2. Total Store Order (TSO): Reads can happen before preceding writes complete. 
        
            🔹 TSO preserves the first three orders (Load → Load, Load → Store, Store → Store) but not Store → Load order.
            
            🔹 x86 CPU.
    
        3. Relaxed Memory Consistency: Allows more reordering of operations for performance. 
        
            🔹 ARM and RISC-V

1. **API Gateway vs Load Balancer**

    🔹 API Gateway: Manages access to backend services, handles tasks like rate-limiting, authentication, logging, and security policies.

    🔹 Load Balancer: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers for high availability and even load distribution.

1. **Web services and APIs (SOAP, RestAPI, GraphQL, gRPC and Kafka)** [ref](https://www.redhat.com/architect/apis-soap-rest-graphql-grpc)

    - **SOAP, RestAPI, GraphQL, gRPC and Kafka**

        🔹SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): XML-based protocol for web services, heayweight, favored for security and reliability.

        🔹REST (Representational State Transfer): Uses HTTP methods, simple and easy to use, but can be resource-heavy.

        🔹GraphQL: Allows flexible data queries, reduces data over-fetching.

        🔹gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**: High-performance RPC framework, ideal for connecting microservices. Built on top of HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers for data exchange.

        🔹Kafka: Distributed streaming platform, uses publish-subscribe model for message queueing. real-time consistency. "at-least-once" delivery.

1. **Real-time communication and messaging (MQTT, AMQP and WebSocket)** [ref](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/amqp-vs-mqtt.html)

    - **MQTT vs AMQP vs WebSocket**

        🔹MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): Lightweight messaging protocol, uses publish-subscribe model, ideal for IoT and M2M communication. Three levels of Quality of Service (QoS): “At most once” (QoS 0), “At least once” (QoS 1), and “Exactly once” (QoS 2).

        🔹AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): Open-standard application layer protocol, robust message delivery, routing, and security features. Two qualities of service: “At most once (delivered once or lost)” and “At least once (delivered one or more times.)”.

        🔹WebSocket: Enables full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection

1. **Reactive programming vs event-driven architecture** [ref](https://reactiveweb.org/reactive-programming-vs-event-driven-key-differences/)
   
    - Event-Driven: Handles user actions or system events. More general and can be used in any context where an event occurs
    - Reactive: Data-driven approach. managing data streams and propagating changes, like in a spreadsheet model.

1. **RABC vs ReABC**: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is an authorization model that assigns permissions based on predefined roles. On the other hand, ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control) extends RBAC’s capabilities by considering relationships between entities.
1. **Conway's law**: Software engineering principle that states that the structure of a system reflects the structure of the organization that designs it.
1.  Data Management in Distributed systems (Partitioning, Shuffling and Bucketing)

    - **Partitioning vs Shuffling vs Bucketing**

        🔹Partitioning: The process of dividing a large dataset into smaller parts, known as partitions. This process splits Hive table's files into multiple files. For example, `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1`.

        🔹Shuffling: Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across different partitions. The overhead of operations can be ranked as follows: `orderby` > `join` > `groupby`.

        🔹Bucketing: This is the process of decomposing data into manageable parts based on a certain column, thereby improving query performance and storage efficiency. It is best used when there are very few repeating values in a column (for example 1. a primary key column). For instance, Bucket0: `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1/000000_0`, Bucket1: `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1/000001_0`, and so on.

1. **SSO (Single Sign-On)** is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

    - **SSO workflow, Types of SSO, SSO Implementations**

        🔹SSO workflow: Identity Provider (IdP), Service Provider (SP), SSO Server
        - IdP: Central Authentication server e.g., Google
        - SP: Individual Applications rely on SSO e.g, Trello
        - SSO Server: Bridge between IdP and SPs

        🔹Types of SSO: SAML, OAuth (Open Authorization) 2.0, Open ID Connect (OIDC)

        | Protocol | Purpose | Token Format | - |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | OAuth 2.0 | Open standard for Authorization | Access Tokens | Temporary access to 3rd party app |
        | OpenID Connect (OIDC) | Open standard for Authentication | JSON Web Token (JWT) | Newer type of SSO based on OAuth 2.0, Straightforward protocol than SAML |
        | SAML | Authentication, Authorization | XML | Most common, Use SAML Protocol to exchange authentication between SSO server and SP |

        🔹Some other Types of SSO: Kerberos, Smart card authentication
        - Kerberos: Less suitable for internet-facing SSO due to the shared secret between KDC (Key Distributin Center) and all participants.
        - Smart card authentication: Physical card

        🔹SSO Implementations: Microsoft Entra ID (FKA Micorsoft Active Directory), Okta, Ping Identity, OneLogin, Auth0

1. Deployment Styles: Blue/Green, Canary, and A/B

    - **Blue/Green, Canary, A/B**

        🔹Blue/Green Deployment: Two identical environments, "Blue" and "Green". Deploy new version in inactive environment, test, then switch users to it. For example, AWS supports blue/green deployment strategies including Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks, CloudFormation, CodeDeploy, and Amazon ECS.

        🔹Canary Deployment: Roll out new version to a small group of users, monitor feedback, then do a full-scale release.

        🔹A/B Testing: Compare two versions of a webpage or app to see which performs better. A typical example of A/B testing is website usability testing.

1. **Flaky Test**: A Flaky Test is a test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails, despite no changes in the code. Causes can include poorly written tests, async waits, test order dependency, and concurrency issues. They can slow down CI/CD pipelines and cause issues for end users. [ref](https://github.com/jmicco/JaSST_tutorial)

        B -->|Southbound APIs| C[Infrastructure layer - physical switches, data plane]
    ```

    🔹The **Controller** is the SDN network's brain, directing traffic flows.

    🔹 The **Southbound Interface** communicates the controller's decisions to the switches using protocols like OpenFlow.

    🔹**SDN Switches** direct traffic based on the controller's instructions.

    🔹**Network Devices** (servers, routers, etc.) send and receive data flows as directed by the SDN switches.

    🔹The **Northbound Interface** uses APIs to exchange data between the controller and applications.

    🔹**SDN Applications** use network data to perform tasks, communicating their needs to the controller.

1. **Azure vs AWS vs GCP in Cloud Network**

    🔹**Cloud Network Structures:**

    - **AWS:** region → VPC → availability zone → subnet (public, private)
    - **Azure:** region → VNet → availability zone → subnet
    - **GCP:** global → VPC → subnet (region-specific)

    🔹**Traffic Between VNet or VPC:**

    - Set up a VNet or VPC gateway and configure the routing table.
    - **Azure:** One VPN gateway per virtual network, supporting external and on-premise connectivity.
    - **Azure:** Routing tables can be assigned at the subnet level.
    - **AWS:** Routing tables are associated at the VPC level, determining traffic between subnets.
    - **GCP:** Routing tables are associated with the VPC, not the subnet. Routes are determined by subnet CIDR ranges.

    🔹**Regional Traffic:**
    - Use peering for traffic between VNets or VPCs in the same region.
    - Peering provides lower latency, higher bandwidth, and reduced costs compared to gateways

    🔹**Hybrid Connectivity:**
    - Required for on-premise networks to connect to cloud networks.
    - Services used: Azure ExpressRoute, AWS Direct Connect, GCP Cloud Interconnect.

    🔹**Connectivity Scenario**

    - In Azure, the equivalent of AWS Transit Gateway is Azure Virtual WAN
    - Azure and GCP don’t have a direct concept of public and private subnets like AWS.
    - An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Gateway can serve as a VPN gateway or an ExpressRoute gateway. Site-to-Site, Point-to-Site, and VNet-to-VNet connections all use a VPN gateway.
        - Point-to-site: Individual device to network.
        - Site-to-site: Network to network.
    - Private IP vs Public IP: `192.168.1.4` (not routable on the internet) vs `34.207.152.137`

1. **Mixin** = Interface + actual implementation. It is a class that provides reusable methods/behavior to other classes without requiring full inheritance.
1. Compiler Framework: **LLVM vs GCC**

    🔹**GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Originally released in 1987, GCC translates C code to RTL (Register Transfer Language), then to machine code. It supports many languages, including C, C++, Fortran, and more. Licensed under the GPL, GCC is known for its robust optimizations and is widely used for system-level programming and cross-platform compilation. 
    `C code ---> GCC's C frontend ---> RTL ---> GCC's x86 backend ---> x86 machine code`

    🔹**LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine)**: First released in 2003, LLVM uses an Intermediate Representation (IR) and a modular design, translating code to machine code via various backends. It supports a variety of languages, such as C, C++, Swift, Rust, and others. LLVM is Apache 2.0 licensed and is recognized for its flexibility, extensibility, and modern features, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

    🔹Key Differences: LLVM's modularity and permissive licensing foster broader tool integration and extensibility, while GCC is renowned for its mature optimization capabilities.

1. Generic: PECS: Producer Extends, Consumer Super

   🔹Producer Extends → Covariance → Only Read (you can only read from the collection). `subtype (? extends T)`: **Pepper Cola**: <b>P</b>roducer <b>E</b>xtend <b>CO</b>variance <b>R</b>ead

   🔹Consumer Super → Contravariance → Only Add (reading is restricted). `supertype (? super T)`: **Corn Salsa**: <b>CON</b>(travariance|sumer) <b>S</b>uper <b>A</b>dd

   ```java
    // Producer: Extends (covariant), meaning we provide data of a more specific type
    public static void produce(List<? extends Shape> shapes) {
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            shape.draw();
        }
    }

    // Consumer: Super (contravariant), meaning we accept data of a more general type
    public static void consume(List<? super Shape> shapes) {
        shapes.add(new Circle());   // We can add a Circle, because Shape is the supertype
        shapes.add(new Rectangle()); // We can add a Rectangle, same reason
    }
   ```

1. 9 Clean Code Principles To Keep In Mind: [ref](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep162-9-clean-code-principles-to)

    🔹 **Meaningful Names:** Use clear, descriptive names.  
    🔹 **Small Functions:** Functions should do one thing well.  
    🔹 **Avoid Duplicates:** **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself).   
    🔹 **Readable Code:** Code should be easy to read and understand.  
    🔹 **Single Responsibility Principle:** One class or function should have only one reason to change.  
    🔹 **Consistent Formatting:** Use a uniform style for indentation, spacing, etc.  
    🔹 **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and explicitly.  
    🔹 **Write Tests:** Tests improve code reliability.  
    🔹 **Refactor Regularly:** Keep improving code to avoid decay.  

1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD): [ref](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/domain-driven-design-ddd-demystified)

    🔹 **Focus on the Core Domain:** Identify and model the essential part of the business.  
    🔹 **Ubiquitous Language:** Create a shared language between developers and domain experts.  
    🔹 **Bounded Contexts:** Divide the system into explicit boundaries where a model applies.  
    🔹 **Entities and Value Objects:** Entities have identity; value objects are immutable.  
    🔹 **Aggregates:** Group related entities to maintain consistency.  
    🔹 **Domain Events:** Capture important business events explicitly.  
    🔹 **Repositories:** Provide a way to retrieve and persist domain objects.  
    🔹 **Continuous Collaboration:** Domain experts and developers work closely.
