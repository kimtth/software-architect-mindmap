    🔹 Abstractly speaking, a landing zone helps you plan for and design an Azure deployment, by conceptualizing a designated area for placement and integration of resources. 

    There are two types of landing zones:

    1. `platform landing zone`: provides centralized enterprise-scale foundational services for workloads and applications.
    2. `application landing zone`: provides services specific to an application or workload.

    <summary>Architecture Styles vs Patterns vs Design Patterns</summary>

        𝟭. 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲𝘀

        This is the highest level of abstraction, where architectural designs instruct us on structuring our code. The highest level of granularity describes the application's layers and high-level modules and how they relate to and interact with one another. Examples of architectural styles include:
        🔹 Monolith
        🔹 Layered
        🔹 Event-driven
        🔹 Self-contained Systems
        🔹 Microservices
        🔹 Space-Based

        𝟮. 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀

        These patterns represent a way to implement an architectural style, so we can do this regularly. Some examples are how to separate the user interface (UI) and data, how internal modules interact, and what layers we will use. Patterns answer these types of questions. They usually impact the code base and how to structure the code inside. Examples of architectural patterns include:

        🔹 Model-View-Presenter (MVP): 1:1 Relationship between View and Presenter. e.g., Windows forms
        🔹 Model-View-Controller (MVC): e.g., Smalltalk, ASP.Net MVC
        🔹 Model–View–Viewmodel (MVVM): One to Many relationship between View and ViewModel. e.g., Silverlight, WPF, AngularJs: 
        🔹 Domain-Driven Design

        𝟯. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀

        These differ from architectural patterns in that they focus on a smaller code base area and have a smaller influence (focus on a local problem). These include limiting the creation of a class to only one object or notifying all dependent objects when the internal state of an object is changed. These patterns are described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides from 1994.

    <summary>SC vs TSO vs Relaxed Memory Consistency</summary>

        𝟭. Sequential Consistency (SC): Operations execute in order as per the program.
        🔹 SC preserves order for two memory operations from the same thread for all four combinations of loads and stores (Load → Load, Load → Store, Store → Store, and Store → Load). 
        🔹 MIPS R10000

        𝟮. Total Store Order (TSO): Reads can happen before preceding writes complete. 
        🔹 TSO preserves the first three orders (Load → Load, Load → Store, Store → Store) but not Store → Load order.
        🔹 x86 CPU.
    
        𝟯. Relaxed Memory Consistency: Allows more reordering of operations for performance. 
        🔹 ARM and RISC-V

1.  Data Management in Distributed systems (Partitioning, Shuffling and Bucketing)

    <details>

    <summary>Partitioning vs Shuffling vs Bucketing</summary>

    🔹Partitioning: The process of dividing a large dataset into smaller parts, known as partitions. This process splits Hive table's files into multiple files. For example, `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1`.

    🔹Shuffling: Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across different partitions. The overhead of operations can be ranked as follows: `orderby` > `join` > `groupby`.

    🔹Bucketing: This is the process of decomposing data into manageable parts based on a certain column, thereby improving query performance and storage efficiency. It is best used when there are very few repeating values in a column (for example 1. a primary key column). For instance, Bucket0: `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1/000000_0`, Bucket1: `../hive/warehouse/sales_table/product_id=P1/000001_0`, and so on.

1. SSO (Single Sign-On) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

    <details>

    <summary>SSO workflow, Types of SSO, SSO Implementations</summary>

    🔹SSO workflow: Identity Provider (IdP), Service Provider (SP), SSO Server
    - IdP: Central Authentication server e.g., Google
    - SP: Individual Applications rely on SSO e.g, Trello
    - SSO Server: Bridge between IdP and SPs

    🔹Types of SSO: SAML, OAuth (Open Authorization) 2.0, Open ID Connect (OIDC)

    | Protocol | Purpose | Token Format | - |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | OAuth 2.0 | Open standard for Authorization | Access Tokens | Temporary access to 3rd party app |
    | OpenID Connect (OIDC) | Open standard for Authentication | JSON Web Token (JWT) | Newer type of SSO based on OAuth 2.0, Straightforward protocol than SAML |
    | SAML | Authentication, Authorization | XML | Most common, Use SAML Protocol to exchange authentication between SSO server and SP |

    🔹Some other Types of SSO: Kerberos, Smart card authentication
    - Kerberos: Less suitable for internet-facing SSO due to the shared secret between KDC (Key Distributin Center) and all participants.
    - Smart card authentication: Physical card

    🔹SSO Implementations: Microsoft Entra ID (FKA Micorsoft Active Directory), Okta, Ping Identity, OneLogin, Auth0

    <summary>Expand</summary>

    🔹**Cloud Network Structures:**

    - **AWS:** region → VPC → availability zone → subnet (public, private)
    - **Azure:** region → VNet → availability zone → subnet
    - **GCP:** global → VPC → subnet (region-specific)

    🔹**Traffic Between VNet or VPC:**

    - Set up a VNet or VPC gateway and configure the routing table.
    - **Azure:** One VPN gateway per virtual network, supporting external and on-premise connectivity.
    - **Azure:** Routing tables can be assigned at the subnet level.
    - **AWS:** Routing tables are associated at the VPC level, determining traffic between subnets.
    - **GCP:** Routing tables are associated with the VPC, not the subnet. Routes are determined by subnet CIDR ranges.

    🔹**Regional Traffic:**
    - Use peering for traffic between VNets or VPCs in the same region.
    - Peering provides lower latency, higher bandwidth, and reduced costs compared to gateways

    🔹**Hybrid Connectivity:**
    - Required for on-premise networks to connect to cloud networks.
    - Services used: Azure ExpressRoute, AWS Direct Connect, GCP Cloud Interconnect.

    🔹**Connectivity Scenario**

    | Connectivity Scenario     | AWS                                                  | Azure                                              | GCP                                               |
    |---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
    | VPC (VNet) <-> VPC (VNet) | VPC Peering, AWS Transit Gateway                     | VNet Peering, Azure Virtual WAN, VNet Gateway  | VPC Network Peering, Cloud VPN                     |
    | On-Premise <-> VPC (VNet) | Virtual Private Gateway, AWS Direct Connect, AWS Transit Gateway | VPN Gateway, Azure ExpressRoute, Azure Virtual WAN | Cloud VPN, Cloud Interconnect                      |
    | VNet (VPC) <-> Internet   | Internet Gateway (public subnet), NAT Gateway (private subnet) | Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway                      | Cloud Router, Cloud NAT                           |
    | Subnet Traffic Control    | Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) | Network Security Groups (NSGs) | 1. Shared VPC (XPN) subnets and set permissions at project or subnet level 2. Firewall Rules (VM level). |

    - In Azure, the equivalent of AWS Transit Gateway is Azure Virtual WAN
    - Azure and GCP don’t have a direct concept of public and private subnets like AWS.
    - An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Gateway can serve as a VPN gateway or an ExpressRoute gateway. Site-to-Site, Point-to-Site, and VNet-to-VNet connections all use a VPN gateway.
        - Point-to-site: Individual device to network.
        - Site-to-site: Network to network.
    - Private IP vs Public IP: `192.168.1.4` (not routable on the internet) vs `34.207.152.137`

    |------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
    | 1                      | Organization         | Management Group    | Organization|
    | 2                      | Organizational Unit (OU) | Subscription    | Folder      |
    | 3                      | Account              | Resource Group      | Project     |
    | 4                      | Resources            | Resources           | Resources   |
