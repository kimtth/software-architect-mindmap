    ðŸ”¹ Abstractly speaking, a landing zone helps you plan for and design an Azure deployment, by conceptualizing a designated area for placement and integration of resources. 

    There are two types of landing zones:

    1. `platform landing zone`: provides centralized enterprise-scale foundational services for workloads and applications.
    2. `application landing zone`: provides services specific to an application or workload.
